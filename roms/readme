================================================================================

Utaco was originally an entry for A Game By Its Cover (http://www.agbic.com/).
The contest idea was to choose a fake cartridge art (with an special focus on
Famicompo entries) and then develop that game in a month.
One of those entries, was うたいたガールUTACO~「ＩＩコンは世界を救う？！」
(http://famicase.com/11/softs/41.html).
The main idea of a game played with the almost-never-used famicom microphone
seemed fun enough to try to implement, so that is how I choose it.

The game was not finished when the competition ended, but with some work on the 
following months, it reached its actual status. 

For more information about the game check the "booklet" directory.

Altough the game uses the microphone, the B button can also be used when a mic
is not available (NES)

The game cutscenes are available in English, Japanese and Spanish. Unfortunately,
the lyrics are only in japanese. If you can't read them, you are encouraged to 
make up whatever you want while singing.

The game source is included. Everything needed to build it with ca65 is included
albeit some editing of the build scripts and fixing of paths may be needed.
It's worth noting that the source is not interesting and very badly written.
