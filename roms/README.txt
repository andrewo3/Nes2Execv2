SIMPLISTIC

This is a simple game that - get this - was first
designed for play on a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 control
brick (that game actually almost got completed), and a
few years later, the creator learned how to program in
NES 6502 Assembly, and the game was soon remade for the
NES, in two-player form. Thank you for playing, and
please leave a review if you liked it!

You (and second player) are the blue dots. That red
thing on the right side of the screen? That's a bad guy.
Press START to begin (same with 2p). The bad guy starts
coming at you! What do you do? 


Controls: 

A: Act
B: Speed up bad guy
START: pause game (only pauses for the player that
presses it)


Game mechanics are simple;

When the bad guy gets close enough (Within about 10
pixels) press A. It's gotta be timed right!

You'll notice that you and the bad guy switch places,
and he keeps on going, then loops around the screen for
another pass. Also, that green arrow thing moves. It
keeps track of your best score. If you don't press A
when the bad guy gets to you, or press it at the wrong
time, you move back eight pixels. The goal is to
ultimately get to the other side before the other
player.
